    <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>1 15-oz can fire-roasted tomatoes</li>
            <li>2 tsp chili powder</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, finely grated</li>
            <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 8-oz boneless skinless chicken breast</li>
            <li>4 10-inch (burrito size) flour tortillas</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded Oaxaca cheese</li>
            <li>1 cup refried beans</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp unsalted butter</li>
            <li>Guacamole, salsa, chopped scallions and sour cream, for serving</li>
        </ul>


    <h2><strong>DIRECTIONS</strong></h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Combine the tomatoes, chili powder, garlic, 2/3 cup water and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a small saucepan. Bring to a simmer over medium heat and cook, breaking up the tomatoes with a spoon, for 10 minutes. Add the chicken breast, nestling it in the sauce, and simmer, flipping once, until cooked through, 8 to 9 minutes per side. Transfer the chicken to a plate, shred it, and return it to the sauce. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Lay a tortilla on a work surface and top evenly with 1/2 cup Oaxaca cheese. Add a quarter of the shredded chicken and tomato sauce and a quarter of the beans. Fold the tortilla in half to enclose the fillings. Repeat with the remaining tortillas and ingredients.</li>
            <li>Melt 1/2 tablespoon butter in a large nonstick or cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Cook one of the quesadillas, flipping once, until golden brown and the cheese is melted, about 3 minutes per side. Remove to a cutting board and repeat with the remaining quesadillas.</li>
            <li>Cut into triangles and serve with the guacamole, salsa, scallions and sour cream.</li>
        </ol>
